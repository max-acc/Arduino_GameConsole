# Arduino_GameConsole

## Introduction

## Progress

### Version 1.0
This is a non working version because I accidentally mixed up the x and y axis and started all over again.

### Version 1.1
This is the first working version of the game **Pong**.
The code is bad documented an not that efficient written. The primary goal of this version was to build a working version.

### Version 1.2
I'm currently working on this version to improve efficiency, difficulty and trying to provide a better documentation of the code.

## Future roadmap for this project
