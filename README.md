## Introduction

## Progress

### Version 1.0
Goal: Building the game Pong.

This is a non working version because I accidentally mixed up the x and y axis and started all over again.

### Version 1.1
This is the first working version of the game **Pong**.

The code is bad documented an not that efficient written. The primary goal of this version was to build a working version.

### Version 1.2
This version was about improving efficiency of the code and providing a better documentation of the code.

Accidentally the code was messed up again and the only solution for this problem was to develop a new version and write all over again.

### Version 1.2.1
This is the currently work-in-progress-version.

This version improves efficiency and readability of the code. The spawnpoint of the ball has also been updated. It will spawn now randomly on at position where it is makeable for both players to hit the ball. The highscore has been increased to five so the game takes longer . Those changes made the game more fun.

### Version 1.3
The difficulty of the game will increase. You will be able to choose between difficulties (easy, medium, hard, super hard).


### Version 2.0
Goal: Building the game TicTacToe.

### Version 3.0
Goal: Building the game Snake.

### Version 4.0
Goal: Building the game PacMan.
