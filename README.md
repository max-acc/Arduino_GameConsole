## Introduction

## Progress

### Version 1.0
Goal: Building the game Pong.  
This is a non working version because I accidentally mixed up the x and y axis and started all over again.

### Version 1.1
This is the first working version of the game **Pong**.  
The code is bad documented an not that efficient written. The primary goal of this version was to build a working version.

### Version 1.2.0
This version was about improving efficiency of the code and providing a better documentation of the code.  
Accidentally the code was messed up again and the only solution for this problem was to develop a new version and write all over again.

### Version 1.2.1
This version improves efficiency and readability of the code. The spawnpoint of the ball has also been updated. It will spawn now randomly on at position where it is makeable for both players to hit the ball. The highscore has been increased to five so the game takes longer. Those changes made the game more fun to play.

### Version 1.2.2
This is the currently work-in-progress-version.  
This version includes minor bug fixes and improvements referring to the bats and the highscore system (the 2 has been outputted in a wrong way). The bats are now pixel by pixel calculated and the ball is able to be at the same y-position as the bats.

### Version 1.3.0
The difficulty of the game will increase. You will be able to choose between difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, Super Hard).  
- Easy: The ball bounces of in a normal way and the speed of the ball and bats increase slowly, but it won't get that fast.
- Medium: The ball bounces of in a normal way but the speed of the ball and bats increase faster and it will get pretty fast.
- Hard: The ball bounces off in a random direction and speed is equal to Easy.
- Super Hard: Super hard is a mix of Medium and Hard. The ball bounces off in random directions and it will get pretty fast.

### Version 1.4.0
Preparing the program for version 2.0.  
It will be about renaming the variables and functions which are only referring to Pong.

### Version 2.0
Goal: Building the game TicTacToe.

### Version 3.0
Goal: Building the game Snake.

### Version 4.0
Goal: Building the game ConnectFour.

### Version 5.0
Goal: Building the game PacMan.
